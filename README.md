##Phlog Easy

A Node/Express/Mongo/Backbone based single-paged photo-blogging platform with a mobile-first design.

Originally derived from a fork of http://github.com/felizuno/ewing.io


##Usage

Spin it up in whatever directory you want, put your templates in the templates folder, create an images folder in public, and it will do the rest. Images folders need to have the same names as the links you're using to get pictures, as it creates an object of image urls for each folder on launch.


##TODO

-create template for single image view

-Lots of style love and responsiveness
