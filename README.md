##Phlog Easy

A Node/Express/Backbone based photo-blogging platform with a mobile-first design.

Originally derived from a fork of http://github.com/felizuno/ewing.io


##Usage

Spin it up in whatever directory you want, put your templates in the templates folder, create an images folder in public, and it will pretty much do the rest. Images folders need to have the same names as the links you're using to get pictures, as it creates an object of image urls for each folder on launch.

e.g. - href='/images/seattle' will load pictures from ./public/images/seattle 


##TODO

-Lots of style love and responsiveness

-Get Nodejitsu and put it live for people to play with?

-Add more interactive fun-ness?
