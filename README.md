##Phlog Easy

A Node/Express/Backbone based photo-blogging platform with a mobile-first design.

Originally derived from a fork of http://github.com/felizuno/ewing.io

Designed to work in conjunction with the tools in http://github.com/louisnk/basic_utilities.git, which should be in the root, in a directory labeled 'node'.


##Usage

Spin it up in whatever directory you want, put your templates in the templates folder, create an images folder in public, and it will do the rest. Images folders need to have the same names as the links you're using to get pictures, as it creates an object of image urls for each folder on launch.

e.g. - href='/images/seattle' will load pictures from ./public/images/seattle 


##TODO

-front load image data JSON

-Lots of style love and responsiveness

-????
